    "\n",
    "#### Initialization: [5pts: 2pts + 3pts Bonus for Undergrad]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kmeans algorithm is sensitive to how the centers are initialized. The naive approach is to randomly initialize the centers. However, a bad initialization can increase the time required for convergence or may even converge to a non-optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **init_centers** [2pts]: Here you will initialize the centers randomly **(Required for all)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Please initialize centers by randomly sampling points from the dataset in case the autograder fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **kmpp_init** [3pts Bonus for Undergrad]: Here you will use the intuition that points further away from each other will probably be better initial centers by implementing a version of KMeans++ **(Bonus for Undergrad, required for Grads)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: We need to initialize the centers without repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### KMeans++\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for KMPP that you will implement can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample 1% of the points from the dataset, uniformly at random (UAR) and without replacement. This sample will be the dataset the remainder of the algorithm uses to minimize initialization overhead.\n",
    "2. From the above sample, select only one random point to be the first cluster center.\n",
    "3. For each point in the sampled dataset, find the nearest cluster center and record the squared distance to get there.\n",
    "4. Examine all the squared distances and take the point with the maximum squared distance as a new cluster center. In other words, we will choose the next center based on the maximum of the minimum calculated distance instead of sampling randomly like in step 2. You may break ties arbitrarily.\n",
    "5. Repeat 3-4 until all k-centers have been assigned. You may use a loop over K to keep track of the data in each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Cluster Assignments: [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've chosen your centers, you will need to update the membership of each point based on the closest center.\n",
    "You will implement this in **update_assignment**. See docstring for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Centers Assignments: [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since cluster memberships may have changed, you will need to update the cluster centers. You will implement this in **update_centers**. See docstring for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss & Convergence [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider KMeans to be converged when the change in loss drops below a threshold value. The loss will be\n",
    "defined as the sum of the squared distances between each point and its respective center.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You may use a loop over K to keep track of the data in each cluster. Avoid looping over N individual datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train the model [10pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **train** method you will use all of the previously implemented steps to train your KMeans algorithm until convergence. Since the centers have already been initialized in the **init** function the general steps for the `train` method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Update the cluster assignment for each point\n",
    "2. Update the cluster centers based on the new assignments from Step 1\n",
    "3. Check to make sure there is no [mean without a cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAU0gQXn28s), i.e. no cluster center without any points assigned to it.\n",
    "   - In the event of a cluster with no points assigned, pick a random point in the dataset to be the new center and update your cluster assignment accordingly.\n",
    "4. Calculate the loss and check if the model has converged to break the loop early.\n",
    "   - The convergence criteria is measured by whether the percentage difference in loss compared to the previous iteration is less than the given relative tolerance threshold (self.rel_tol).\n",
    "5. Iterate through steps 1 to 4 max_iters times. **Make sure to avoid infinite looping.**\n",

    "1. Why should we add the maximum for each row of $logit$ to **logsumexp()** function? Show your reason by calculating and observing the relationship between $F$ and $s_1$.\n",
    "   <br> -- Use a simple input like $logit \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times 3}$ and work through a mathematical example.\n",
    "   <br> -- Let N=1, D=3, $logit = \\{ logit_{11},logit_{12}, logit_{13} \\} $ and $max = logit_{13}$ is the maximum for this row. $F$ is the an array that substract the maximum for each row of $logits$.\n",
    "   <br> -- Start by subtracting the max of the row from each element in $s_1 = \\log \\big( \\sum_{j=1}^D \\exp(logit_{1, j}) \\big)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure numerical stability in the `logsumexp()` function, we use a technique where we subtract then add back the maximum value of each row of $logit$. This approach prevents overflow or underflow in exponential calculations. Mathematically, for $logit = {logit_{11}, logit_{12}, logit_{13}}$ with $max = logit_{13}$ being the maximum, we first calculate $F = logit_{1j} - max$ for each $j$, which ensures the highest value for exponentiation is $0$. The calculation of $s_1$ becomes $s_1 = \\log \\big( \\sum_{j=1}^D \\exp(F_{j}) \\big) + max$, where $F = {logit_{11} - max, logit_{12} - max, 0}$. This technique maintains accuracy and computational safety by keeping exponentiated values within a manageable range, ensuring that the subtraction and addition of $max$ does not alter the mathematical outcome but aids in stabilizing the computation."

    "To generate points directly from a given distribution is done via Inverse transform sampling. In inverse transform sampling, we require taking the inverse of cummulative distribution function for our gaussian mixture model. This operation in general can be expensive unless there is some known formula for inverting the CDF. It is also not always possible to take the inverse of the CDF of a gaussian mixture model. For these reasons we will implement a sampling method instead. This sampling method will give us points matching the gmm without the computation and mathematical concerns of generation.\n",

    "Conventionally we think of Gaussian Mixture Models as a form of soft clustering, but you can also think of them as an algorithm for estimating density of data points with gaussians. Thus we can take an arbitary data point and using the gaussian mixture model as an estimation for the density at a given location. From here we want the points that we sample to be proportional to the density at a given location.\n",
    "\n",
    "We go about this by, choosing an arbitary point (x,y). Then we use the density formula function $f(x_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi(k) \\mathcal{N}(x_i | \\mu_k, \\Sigma_k)$ to find out what the density of points is at (x,y). Now that we have the density, we can draw a random number between 0 and the maximum density to determine if we will keep or discard (x,y). If the random number drawn is less than the density, then (x,y) is our sample, otherwise we discard (x,y) and repeat. This method ensure that the samples we generate are proportional to the density predicted by our GMM at any given area.\n"

Stationed at a cutting edge Gamma Ray Telescope facility as a Data Scientist, delving into the high-energy physics of the universe, your mission is to probe the enigmatic Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, using a telescope that views the cosmos through gamma rays emitted by the most cataclysmic events in space like neutron star mergers, pulsars, and the voracious accretion disks of black holes. SUPER EXCITING!\n",

    "\n",
    "The kNN and mean methods for imputing missing values offer distinct advantages and drawbacks, fundamentally influenced by the dataset's characteristics and the analytical goals. kNN imputation, leveraging the $k$ most similar data points to estimate missing values, excels in preserving local data patterns and relationships between features, making it particularly suited for complex datasets where such relationships are crucial. However, it demands higher computational resources and is sensitive to the choice of $k$ and the presence of outliers, which can skew imputations. In contrast, mean imputation replaces missing values with the feature's average across available data points, offering simplicity and computational efficiency. Despite its ease of implementation, it overlooks inter-feature relationships and is vulnerable to outliers, potentially leading to less accurate or misleading imputations in skewed distributions. Therefore, the selection between kNN and mean imputation should be guided by a careful consideration of the datasetâ€™s structure, computational constraints, and the importance of capturing intricate data relationships for the analysis or predictive modeling at hand."
