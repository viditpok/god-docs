Question 1
----------

lea $ra, label
beq $zero$, $zero$, target

label: .word 0xFFFF


_________________________________________________________________
This saves the address of label (which is the current address)
into register ra. Then it jumps to the target address with the
label target, since register zero equals register zero.
